The concept of “Italianness” has always been a paradox: historically, Italy was a collection of disparate regions with distinct cultures and languages, unified in the late 19th century as a “nation in search of a state”, which has led to ongoing debates about national identity. Nowadays, Italy faces a different crisis: the tension between legal citizenship criteria and the sociological reality of a new generation of Italians (the “Second Generation”) who identify as culturally Italian but are legally foreigners.
This essay analyzes the current debate around Italian citizenship and the proposal of Ius Scholae (citizenship via education) through the ideas of Nationalism and the Social Construct of Race. 
This essay argues that current Italian citizenship policies institutionalize exclusion by treating “Italianness” as a fixed biological status, rather than embracing it as a dynamic sociological identity shaped by culture and participation.
Fixing this tension requires a shift in the definition of the Italian nation towards shared culture and participation, leaving behind subjective myths of common descent.
To understand the current exclusion of immigrants in Italy, we need to recall the theoretical distinction between nation and ethnie seen in class. As defined in the course materials, an ethnie is a community bound by shared ancestry, cultural elements, and historical memories, often lacking a unified political public culture; while a nation involves a distinct public culture, collective laws, and a perceived homeland.

Italian legislation often conflates the concepts of nation and ethnie, leading to citizenship policies that are explicitly designed to “look backwards” by adhering to the principle of ius sanguinis, thereby maintaining ties with descendants of the "Great Emigration" of Italians abroad, rather than embracing a more inclusive, civic-based approach.
The sociological significance of this is deep. The state has built a legal framework that prioritizes "latent Italians," people who may not even speak Italian or know contemporary culture over immigrants born and raised in Italy. These laws treat citizenship as an asset to be preserved more than a social contract based on residence and shared values, reinforcing an ethno-cultural conception of "ancestral community" where "blood" outweighs "culture.
The limitations of this ethno-centric model are clear when we analyze the status of the children born from foreign parents in Italy (the Second Generation, G2). Under the current law, these children are not citizens at birth and they must wait until age 18 to apply for the difficult pathway to obtain Italian citizenship.

Looking at this situation under the “Nationalistic” perspective, we can distinguish that the G2 population satisfy both of the objective and subjective factors that define a nation (language, territory, shared history) by attending Italian schools, speaking Italian as their first language, and being socialized within the Italian territory. However, the state refuses to recognize these factors as sufficient for membership.

The proposal of Ius Scholae (or Ius Culturae) seeks to address this issue by linking citizenship to school attendance, positioning education as the central factor of socialization. This shift from an ethnic to a civic definition of nation argues that completing a cycle of Italian schooling should be as significant as ancestral ties in determining citizenship.
This topic has been rejected every time it has been brought up in the Italian political landscape, revealing a refusal to accept the sociological reality that culture can be learned and is not just limited to inheritance. When politicians argue that citizenship should be a "reward" for integration rather than a tool for integration, they are essentially ignoring the fact that G2 children are already integrated and that they only lack the bureaucratic stamp to be considered officially Italians.
Why is there such resistance to recognizing G2 children as citizens? In order to give an answer to this question, we need to apply the theory of the Social Construction of Race. As we went through during the lectures, race is not a biological reality but a social category defined by physical traits and historical context. The defense of the ius sanguinis often stands by the construct of defending tradition, but in reality, it functions as a defense of whiteness and specific ethno-cultural purity by excluding those who are non-European, non-white bodies of contemporary immigrants. This is a clear manifestation of "institutional racism," where laws and policies systematically disadvantage minority groups by maintaining a system where an Argentine of remote Italian descent is more easily accepted than a Black child born in Milan, the state institutionalizes a racial hierarchy.

Furthermore, this dynamic also creates a form of "quiet discrimination." By denying citizenship to G2 children, they’re destined to a life of suspicion and bureaucratic hurdles; they lack access to public sector jobs and face deportation fears. This reinforces the "othering" of these individuals, marking them as perpetual guests in their own home.

A compelling contradiction emerges when comparing the treatment of Italian descendants abroad and the immigrants within Italy: the state encourages the re-acquisition of citizenship for those abroad (often of political utility) while it demands rigorous proofs of "integration" from the latter.

I believe that the ius scholar debate highlights this hypocrisy. Some argue that five years of schooling is insufficient to "feel" Italian but the state assumes that someone born in Argentina and never visited Italy possesses an innate Italian feeling only due to bloodline. This suggests that in the eyes of the Italian state, one can only feel Italian due to biological factors, while other objective factors like living and learning in Italy are viewed with suspicion when applied to non-ethnic Italians.
This resistance to Ius Scholae seems to stem from a fear of changing the face of the nation: if "Italian" is no longer synonymous with a specific "phenotype," then the traditional conception of ethnicity vanishes.

The debate over who can become an Italian citizen transcends legal considerations, touching on deeper questions about the cultural and social dimensions of Italian identity and what it truly means to be Italian in a modern, multicultural society. Using the ideas of nationalism and race, it is clear that the current ius sanguinis system is a remnant of an ethno-nationalist past that does not fit with the country's multicultural present.

The Italian government currently uses "blood" as a socially constructed definition of identity. This idea helps keep the traditional white European demographic in power while keeping out the growing diverse population that will be the country's future. The proposed Ius Scholae signifies a crucial sociological shift: acknowledging that national identity is constructed through socialization (education, language, communal experiences) rather than genetic factors.
To respond to the thesis inquiry: What characterizes an individual as "Italian" in contemporary times? Legally, the passport is currently the most important aspect related to ancestry. But from a sociological point of view, it is being a part of the public life and culture of the area. The state will continue to exclude individuals institutionally, creating a class of citizens in spirit who are aliens in law, until Italian law aligns with this sociological reality by adopting mechanisms like Ius Scholae. To have real national unity, we need to stop believing in the myth of the ethnie and start believing in the reality of the civic nation.
